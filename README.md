#### Hey 👋 My name is Pranav Chatur. Nice to meet you 🙏 
Currently I am a Computer Science undergrad 💻. Feel free to check my GitHub profile

###### Here are 5 things about me I feel you should know.

- I am a philomath 👨‍🏫 and a melophile 🎶.
- I am a pianist 🎹, learning different ways to express myself on the piano since past 11 years.
- I also go by "DarkMenacer", but lately it has become more than just a pseudonym .
- An introvert, yet I love to find and discuss things with like-minded people for hours and hours and hours ⌛️...
- It is so hard to summarise myself in 5 lines, please feel free to contact me at pranavchatur@gmail.com. I have so many things to discuss with you.😊

P.S.
I think I should also paste my bio so that I sound professional enough just in case.
Software Undergrad looking for fun and challenging opportunities to develop myself and the company.
